# üéØ Form Validation & API Data Fetching Project

This project demonstrates how to implement client-side form validation and fetch user data asynchronously from a public API using vanilla JavaScript. It is designed as a practical introduction to core front-end development concepts, including DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and user experience design.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, students should be able to:

### 1. **Implement Form Validation**
- Use JavaScript to validate form fields before submission.
- Enforce rules such as:
  - Username must be at least 3 characters long.
  - Email must contain `@` and `.`.
  - Password must be at least 8 characters long.
- Provide visual feedback to users about the status of their input.

### 2. **Work with the DOM**
- Use `document.getElementById()` and other DOM methods to interact with HTML elements.
- Dynamically display messages and update the UI based on user input or fetch results.
- Attach event listeners to respond to user actions, like form submissions.

### 3. **Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs**
- Use the `fetch` API to asynchronously retrieve data from a public API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
- Convert and process JSON responses.
- Dynamically render fetched data into the webpage.
- Handle fetch errors gracefully to inform the user when something goes wrong.

### 4. **Enhance User Experience**
- Use color-coded feedback and error messages for validation results.
- Provide a loading message while fetching API data.
- Use local storage (optional/extendable feature) to persist form data or fetched content across browser sessions.
